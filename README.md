Shooting game project made for CS410-OpenSourceSoftware

## Project Description
This project is a simple game based on the classic arcade game Galaga. When run, a new window opens up and the user enters the game. 
The controls the user has are spacebar to shoot and the left/right arrow keys.
The objective of the game is to live as long as possible by shooting invaders before they get too close!
